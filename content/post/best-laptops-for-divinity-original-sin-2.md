Not everyone now needs a home PC. A huge number of people now work as freelancers, programmers, designers. And as practice shows, such people prefer a powerful gaming laptop that would cope with all sorts of programs and heavy toys. Therefore, below is a list of gaming laptops, which quietly compete, even the most powerful gaming PC.

And the first laptop will be OMEN by HP. First of all, it should be noted the bold angular design of this model. Stylish color scheme. Special attention is given to the mechanical keyboard with a huge number of options for illumination. A distinctive feature of this model is the function of overclocking the CPU frequency and memory. This option allows the user to choose the amount of load on the machine.

Now let's move on to the very hardware laptop.

Good solution for games and work. The model is not the most powerful configuration, but it is able to overcome the novelties of the last years of the gaming industry. Of course, on ultra settings there will not be a perfect fps, but on high, everything will go perfectly.

There is nothing special or unusual in the design. On the top cover of the laptop is the company logo. Black and red color scheme will always be in trend, and will look aggressive.

What can we get from this model?

Very interesting model in its price category. It costs an order of magnitude less, many other laptops with the same configuration. At the same time ASUS VivoBook Pro Thin can boast of its thickness. In profile, its thickness is only 0.8 inches. And weighs just over 2 lbs. With all hardware that is inside him, this amazing settings. And now I tell you why:

|  Parameters   |   Values   |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| Processor       | 8th Generation Intel Core i7-8550U 1.8GHz (Turbo up to 4.0GHz)       |

It should also be noted an excellent cooling system. Two coolers are located in the right and left part of the laptop, the air is out of the holes on the back of the case.

## Razer Blade Pro Gaming Laptop

When we talk about gaming devices, computers, headset, everyone knows that Razer is a professional. And, of course, it is impossible not to mention the guys from Razer, when it comes to gaming laptops. When the laptop is in a closed state, there is nothing unusual. I would even say that it looks very simple. Rounded body, pure black color, minimalistic design. On the top lid flaunts the iconic green logo of the manufacturer. But when you open the laptop, you will be pleasantly surprised.

A bold decision regarding the touchpad. The developers decided to put it not at the bottom, not in the center, and at the level of the keyboard, on the right side of the computer. Above the touchpad is a scroll that will facilitate the work of users. And the cool thing is that all this is highlighted. Yes, it is a trifle, and almost everywhere it is present. But in this model it was made very competently. The on/off Button is located in the center of the top panel, which is also an interesting design move. And that's right, because many companies set the power button next to other keys or close to them. In my opinion, this is not very practical, because during active work or play the user can accidentally turn off the device. Razer has thought about this moment.

What's inside us?

|  Parameters   |   Values   |

| Processor       | Quad-Core 7th gen Intel Core i7 processor       |

| RAM       | 16GB dual-channel memory       |

One of the few without a framework on gaming. Let's go through the appearance. Stylish, modern, made according to all modern trends. There are some interesting solutions. A huge number of connectors. Starting from the card reader and ending with usb 3.0, miniDP 1.3. From the outside on the lid of the laptop there is nothing superfluous, only the company logo. On the inside is a frameless screen.

On the bottom cover is a cast keyboard with backlight. The touchpad is located in the usual place-in the middle of the body. But then the guys from Gigabyte did the same as Razer and placed the power button in the center of the upper part of the case.

Over the cooling system, the developers also messed up. Almost the entire area of the bottom cover of the laptop are openings for ventilation. The company has developed a cooling system specifically for this model of laptop.

So what's inside there? What is necessary to cool so much?

|  Parameters   |   Values   |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| Processor       | Intel Core i7-8750H (2.2GHz-4.1GHz)       |
| Screen       | 15.6" 5mm Thin Bezel FHD 144Hz Pantone X-Rite 1920x1080 IPS anti-glare display LCD       |
| RAM       | 16 GB DDR4       |
| Video card       | NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 GDDR5 8GB Max Q Supports NVIDIA Optimus Technology       |
| The amount of drive       | Memory 512GB M.2 NVME PCIe Gen3 x4 SSD       |
| Keyboard       | cast with backlight. 16.7 million colors       |
| Duration of work without recharging       | 10 hours       |


{{< pros-block >}}
edge-to-Edge screen, good cooling system, competent design.
{{< /pros-block >}}

{{< cons-block >}}
the cost is really high. The cooling system is good, the computer is not heated, but with a heavy load (heavy games) the noise level of the fans rises slightly.
