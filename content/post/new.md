<summary class="am-summary">**My trick for avoiding the slowness everyone is mentioning**
</summary>
For the price I paid, this laptop can't be beat. I applied for an Amazon Store Card while purchasing, which gave me a $40 instant credit, further knocking down the price.

This laptop is small and thin for a 15.6" screen (fits in my 14" laptop sleeve), very light (only 3.7 lbs), and fast (8th gen i5 and 8 GB RAM). As others have said, the only downside is the slow 5400 RPM 1 TB hard drive. As far as that goes, I have a trick to get around it if you're planning to install an SSD. Alternatively, I also have advice if you're planning to stick with the included hard drive. Here it goes.

If you're planning to upgrade to an SSD drive and already have the SSD drive in hand, then do this to avoid the slow hard drive headaches:
<ol>
<li>Boot up the new laptop for the 1st time.</li>
<li>While activating Windows, DO NOT connect to your WiFi.</li>
<li>After Windows fully starts up, install disk cloning software (Macrium Reflect, Acronis, etc.) from a USB flash drive. You can't download the disk cloning software because you are not connected to WiFi.</li>
<li>Shut down the laptop, open it up, and install your SSD drive.</li>
<li>Turn on the laptop again. Use the disk cloning software to clone the hard drive onto your SSD drive.</li>
<li>Turn off the laptop. At this point you have a choice. You can either boot into the BIOS to set your new SSD drive as the default boot drive while keeping the old hard drive installed, or you can just remove the old hard drive to force the laptop to boot off the new SSD.</li>
<li>Turn on the laptop and admire how awesomely fast it starts up from the lightning quick SSD! :-)</li>
<li>Now you can finally connect to your WiFi network and let Windows download and install all it's updates and security patches.</li>
</ol>
The reason I recommend doing this is because you don't want to let Windows try to download and install hundreds of MB's of updates and patches while running off the dog slow 1 TB hard drive. That would take a very long, long time. And the slow hard drive will be at 100% disk utilization for hours or days while it's trying to download and install all these Windows updates. As other people have said, the laptop will seem to freeze and be unresponsive during this time. But by upgrading to an SSD drive BEFORE letting the laptop download and install Windows updates, the fast SSD will make this process go A LOT FASTER.

And my tip for those people who don't plan to install an SSD drive and just keep using the included 1 TB hard drive:
<ol>
<li>After booting up the laptop for the 1st time, activate Windows, and connect to your WiFi.</li>
<li>Then leave the laptop on for a day or two and don't try to use it. Why? Because people have said it can take up to 2 days for the laptop to download and install all the Windows updates. Trying to use it during this time, with the hard drive utilization pegged at 100%, would be a exercise in frustration.</li>
<li>Then finally, after all the Windows updates have been downloaded and installed, reboot the laptop and use it as you wish. The laptop should be fairly speedy now after the initial slowness from the updates. Enjoy!</li>
</ol>

<summary class="am-summary">**Great but some obvious improvements though**</summary>
Great great great laptop. Love it, strong upgrade from my aging Core i3. I followed the popular recommendations to purchase the 128GB SSD along with the 1TB hard drive. Very fast, nice screen, like the fingerprint sensor. Here are the shortcomings that keep it from a 5.
<ol>
<li>Power key is located within the keyboard up at the top right corner. It is adjacent to the often used Delete, Backspace, and Home keys. Really? This passed their use case criteria? I often miss the Delete or Backspace keys and am accidentally putting my laptop into sleep. Several decades of best practices in designing laptops has led to this? Sigh. Deep. Sigh. Found the workaround at a CNET article. Since Amazon won't allow URL's in reviews, just Google "Asus Vivobook power button" and it will be the first link.</li>

<li>Keyboard is not backlit. This should be a simple feature addition that is minor in terms of cost. Merely an LED and a light tube. Would have been worth a few extra buck were this to be included in their bill of materials.</li>

<li>No Ethernet port. Sometimes it's necessary to be hardwired into a router to configure things.</li>
</ol>

<summary class="am-summary">**Great laptop for the price!!**</summary>
Not sure why the guy gave a 1 star when he hasn't even purchased one, but got mine today. It does have an IPS screen, battery life is going strong, and no touch pad issues. For $499, you can't beat it. It's fast for what it is, will pop in a small SSD for the OS at some point possibly, but in no rush as it's not given me any lag or issues yet at all. Highly recommend, can't beat the price!
_PS the color in the photos is darker than it is in reality due to crappy lighting, so again pay no attention to Bob with his 1 star review on a laptop he doesn’t own. I added another photo with some better lighting. It is a grey laptop, not black_

<summary class="am-summary">**I absolutely love this beyond any computer/tablet device I have purchased in ...**</summary>
I absolutely love this beyond any computer/tablet device I have purchased in the last 10 years, trust me, I've bought a lot of them along the way. With the power of the internet and all the online productivity products the simplicity of this is fantastic. The addition of the play store puts the device into a sweet spot no other device can come close to matching. I've been in IT support for over 15 years and have seen a lot of products come and go. What I have learned is an appreciation of simplistic technology, in aesthetics and use, Apple was really onto something in their approach with their i-devices. I no longer desire to tinker and tweak and fidget with my technology, I just want it to function and remain reliable. . . this Asus Chromebook fits the bill. Can't say enough about my love of this Chromebook.

<summary class="am-summary">**42 days to get minor repair complete - Updated with another issue**</summary>
I purchased this notebook back in July and was initially happy with my purchase. However, after a couple of months the keyboard case started to crack at the corner. I contacted customer service and was told to send the notebook to the repair center where it would be repaired under Warranty. 2 weeks later I received an email informing me the crack was not covered under warranty, and I would need to pay $183. After numerous calls, I then received confirmation the warranty was valid, but only as a ‘one-off’. 2 more weeks go by, and the repair status still shows as ‘in repair’. I called customer service again and was told the issue would be escalated. Another week goes by and still no change. I call again and was told the issue would be escalated again. I asked for the notebook just to be returned as is, and was told that’s not possible as it’s ‘in repair’. In summary, I have been without this device for over a month, have no idea if and when it will be returned, and in what condition.

Day 29 since Asus received my notebook. Still no update, status, supervisor escalation. ‘Bot response to review requested RMA # which was provided same day, but no follow up.

Day 33 - Got same email / escalation from customer service but still no ETA, status, evidence of escalation or Notebook!

Day 42 - Finally received repaired Notebook.

Update - 7/30/18 - Exactly the same issue has occurred with a crack in the keyboard cover on the opposite side. This Chromebook has not been dropped or treated roughly so I can only assume this is a design or manufacturing defect. I have been informed by Asus Customer Service that I would need to return the device (again), and the repair would cost an estimated $210!!!

This device would be a good choice if it weren't so poorly constructed. Now looking elsewhere for a reliable Chromebook.

<summary class="am-summary">**Flip c100 comparison and stylus**</summary>
Much has been written already in reviews, so I'll stick to two things: comparing it to the previous Asus Flip c100, and using a stylus with it (something people thinking about the Samsung Chromebook Plus/Pro would be interested in).

c100 Comparison:
I've had this for only a couple days. It seems pretty fast. A lot faster than the c100. It's much smoother with web pages and android apps, and the touch screen is more responsive. It's still not quiiite as buttery smooth as a macbook pro (it's also only 20-30% of the price, which is crazy). For example, scrolling in a PDF is fast but not super super smooth. The build quality is a bit better than the c100. There's not as much flex, it's a bit more premium feeling. The finish is very very similar. Keyboard is a bit nicer, not tons. So yes, the build quality is way better than the majority of (plastic) chromebooks out there, but not way better than the c100 (because that's already pretty nice). As many have said, it approaches macbook pro build quality (and looks). Screen is slightly brighter than the c100 (not a lot), and slightly better (sharper). The difference is discernible, but certainly not a big difference. Again, a much much better screen than the TN screens on many chromebooks, ..but the c100 screen is also much better than those.

It's significantly larger and heavier than the c100. One of the things I like best about the c100 is how ultraportable it is. Sometimes I forget it's in my bag. The c302 is a significantly bigger laptop. Feels like a 13" to me, coming from such a small one. Bezels are much smaller on the c302, except the bottom one, ...but they're not thin bezels. I've included a bunch of comparison photos. Nearly identical thickness, although the c302 *feels* thicker/more substantial.

Stylus:
I ordered the Meko 2-pack, 2-type stylus. The c302's competitor, the Samsung Chromebook Pro, comes with a stylus. I went with the Asus c302 over the Samsung Pro because I was a bit concerned with the Pro's quality issues and the shorter battery life, ..and to a lesser extent the lack of backlit keyboard. But I did want to use a stylus occasionally for note taking/sketching. Maybe annotating pdf's. I had read in the comments of another review that the pointy/disc stylus type didnt really work with it. For me it *does*. In my experience with the apps I've tried so far (Keep android app, Kami PDF web app, and Sketchbook android app) *both* the point/disc stylus tip and the rounded metallic knob tip types work really well. If I'm writing quickly, there's a very slight lag before things appear, but nothing that will annoy me at all. One Note android app registered well and smoothly, but was more laggy. The way I see it, the main thing you're missing is the palm rejection that you get with the Pro (because it has a pen digitizer in the screen). For casual use, this will work fine for me.
(fyi - all the styluses I've tried with the c100 [including this Meko, either tip] have been miserable and useless.) So I'm very happy and relieved to see it working excellently on the c302.

Final, initial thoughts: For me, the computer is a bit bigger than I would like. Ideally, it would be a 11.5-12" (not 12.5") screen with minimal bezels, which would make it almost as small as the c100. The default scaling 1536x864 looks excellent and sharp to me. Holding it in tablet mode is awkard given it's size and weight - more so than the c100. However, most of the time if I want horizontal tablet mode I'll use the "stand" mode (keyboard face down in my lap, screen angled up). Portrait tablet mode works better than expected because it's thin, has a magnetic closure, and has a large side bezel. I'll try to update this in the coming days and weeks as I use this more. Feel free to ask questions. Overall I'm very happy so far ..just very stingy with my 5-star ratings. I might change it to a 5-star in the coming days.

<summary class="am-summary">**Definitely worth it!**</summary>
I LOVE this laptop! I’ve never bought refurbished products before but apple holds up pretty well for long periods of time so I decided to try this out. I’m so glad I did! I love it! It came so quickly too. It was packaged pretty well, and came with a 90 day warranty. The charger came too. Once I turned it on it was at the factory settings so I was able to start from scratch setting it up with my preferences. This was worth the spend, generally I use HP, but wanted to see what the hype was about for the Apple laptops. I’m so glad I did!

It's really a great deal. It was delivered on time with good packaging. It's good as brand new. No scratches or any deformity. Perfect! I have been using this for my research and presentations and so far there were NO bad issues that I encountered with regards to its performance. I love it. I recommend this to my friends and classmates.

So far, so good. It had just the tiniest of scratches on the front and some unexplained white stuff on it (that sounds bad, but I don't know how else to describe it). Otherwise, it works like a charm so far and I'm pleased with the product. I'll write back if anything malfunctions or goes into disarray.
