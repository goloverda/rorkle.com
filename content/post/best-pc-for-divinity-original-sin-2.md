A series of games Divinity began its development back in 2002 with the game Divine Divinity. During its long history, the series has known both the taste of victory and the bitterness of failure. But, in spite of everything, in 2015 there was a demo version of the game Divinity: Original Sin 2. The gaming community, not that warmly accepted the project, it was delighted. All gamers are waiting for the full release of the game. There were several reasons for that.

One of the primary catalysts that caused such a violent reaction from the community. There has been a decline in the diversity of RPG projects in recent years. Fans of this ancient genre simply missed the hardcore, exciting games. All games that came out in recent years are not entirely consistent with the canons of the genre: the story is weak, the players wanted more freedom of action, tired of the monotonous mechanics, an empty world. Many companies have created a mountain of developers hype around their children, promised players an incredible open world, a sea of dialogue, options for the development of interesting mechanics that are not bored after 2-4 hours of play. And the result was a very fair corridor project.

Also, a problem was the "cardboard" characters. By "cardboard characters" means the characters without any background and the story as a whole. The main characters were not particularly memorable, and talk about the secondary is not worth it. From the open world, there is only one name. In most projects, it looked dry, dull and monotonous.

And now came the long-awaited release of Divinity: Original Sin 2. Divinity: Original Sin 2 could not please. And to exceed all expectations. Its online a hundred is much higher than the most popular games for other studios. They overtook GTA, which no one could throw off the tops. And these statistics are not even taken in the first weeks of the game's release.

What did the players like so much the new brainchild of Larian Studios? The Yong had everything they had been waiting for for years. Ranging from an interesting florid plot, and ending with interesting crafting systems, and cool side quests. A very cool system of the step-by-step fight, a massive number of opportunities: stealth, interaction with the surrounding world. The game also has a realistic physics. That is, during the battle, factors such as water, oil, sulfur, poisons are taken into account. Everything happened as in the real world. Water conducts electricity well, so that the enemy, standing knee-deep in water, you can strike some lightning. You see that around you a huge amount of sulfur-burn it instead sees the explosion abruptly Hollywood. Elegant voice, detailed characters and images of characters, not only the main, but also secondary. Some heroes are revealed fleetingly, just a few words. But such phrases that they are remembered forever. Combine squad as you wish, suck allies, equip them, build relationships with them. Divinity: Original Sin 2 is so diverse that the same mission, but that there is a mission, the same moment in the game you can perform 5-7 different ways. Want to bring peace to others? No problem-communicate, develop, build friendships with others or Vice versa, take your fire and sword.

But the developers have tried well not only on the gameplay part of the game, but also on its visualization. Study of characters and inside the game world at a height. Facial animations, movements, the behavior of the characters. All this deserves special praise. But, especially strongly want to note the schedule during the fighting. This topic can be placed in a separate article. During the battle there is so much action and explosions, not every video card will be able to endure it. Developers tenderly and lovingly treated each moment in the game. The quality of drawing all these special effects pleasing to the eye, even the most avid player.

But the beauty of the game is directly proportional to the quality of components of your computer. Therefore, the Studio has put forward such minimum and recommended system requirements:

Another representative of compact desktop computers.  Despite its minimalistic design and small size, it is a fairly productive machine for games and work.

The case is made in a minimalist design. On the top of the front panel is the logo of HP. Below is a DVD-ROM, a card reader, a 3.5 mm headphone jack and two USB ports (3.0 / 3.0 Type-C).

What is under cover of this computer? And there we are:

| Parameters     | Values     |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| Processor       | AMD Ryzen(TM) 5 1400 Processor, Quad-Core, 3.20GHz       |
| Video card       | NVIDIA(R) GeForce(R) GTX 1060       |
| RAM       | 16 GB DDR4-2400 SDRAM       |
| HDD и SSD       | 1 TB 7200RPM SATA and 128 GB SSD       |

{{< pros-block >}}
Yes, this model will be weaker than the previous one. But it will be a good solution for games and work with different applications. The presence of SSD drive significantly speeds up the processing of data, and the video card will cope with high loads.

Of the advantages it is worth noting the low cost, good configuration, excellent design.
{{< /pros-block >}}

{{< cons-block >}}
By cons can be attributed to the cover of the body, which will be visible fingerprints and spots. Rather I hope.
